I'm a senior college student Major in Biosystems Engineering, [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/english/). I'm interested in robotics, especially numerical analysis application and motion planning area.
I was shortlisted for the Mitacs 2020 Summer Internship @University of Toronto, but I was not able to go to Canada due to the COVID-19.
From Oct 2019 to Mar 2020, I studied at the department of mechanical engineering at Technische Universität München, TUM, as an exchange student.
I was born in March 2000, in Jiangxi, China. I grew up in [Jingdezhen](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%99%AF%E5%BE%B7%E9%95%87%E5%B8%82), which is renowned for its porcelain.
