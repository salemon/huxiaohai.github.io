I'm a senior student Major in Biosystems Engineering, [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/english/). I'm interested in of robotics, especially numerical analysis application and motion planning area.
I was shortlisted for the Mitacs 2020 Summer Internship @University of Toronto, but I was not able to go to Canada due to the COVID-19.
From Oct 2019 to Mar 2020, I studied at department of mechanical engineering in Technische Universität München, TUM, as an exchange student.
I was born in March 2000, Jiangxi, China. I grew up in [Jindezhen](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%99%AF%E5%BE%B7%E9%95%87%E5%B8%82), which is renowned for its porcelain.

1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section


How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
